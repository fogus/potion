Maybe we need extra tickets as we implement them.\n\nOptional args without defaults are encoded as `|` (default value: `nil`).\nDefaults for those are already implemented in my `perl11/p2` branch and will be backported. \n  `\u003cname\u003e = \u003ctype\u003e := \u003cvalue\u003e` or just `\u003cname\u003e := \u003cvalue\u003e` taking the type from the value.\n\n`get_caller` introspection was also requested from others.\n\nThe method parser is super simplistic and error prone, sure. \nI'm trying to improve that in my `perl11/expr` branch, but it's not easy.\n\n`long` as `int` should be easily fixable, good catch.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"dc8a501266912e06a2fdd3f9cafe05d1338b8aad"},"timestamp":1381860790,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzU4NTk0","github-url":"https://github.com/perl11/potion/issues/8#issuecomment-26358594"},"message":"Optional arguments are now in.","files":null}]}
