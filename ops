To calculate `2 * (3 + 4)`, you have to type something like `2 * :3 + 4.()` or `2 * (3 + 4)(0)`. There should probably be an easier way to do this, like surrounding the expression to evaluate first with a character (ex. `/3 + 4/` or `|3 + 4|` or `{3 + 4}`). I think that they should be grouped with a `:` at the start and a `;` at the end, like `2 * :3 + 4;`. This syntax would be similar to the closure syntax.","files":null}]}
