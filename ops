This is the usual way that `make` operates, but your Makefile goes to some lengths to suppress this, and provides no option to turn this suppression off.\n\nOther projects offer the variable `V` which can be set to `1` to produce the usual verbose output, while setting `V` to `0` would produce the abbreviated output you're currently producing.","files":null}]}
