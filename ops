Whenever I try to evaluate a function in the repl \nlike so:\n\n```\n\u003e\u003e add = (x, y):\n    x + y string print.\n\n\u003e\u003e add (1, 2)\n```\n\nIt will always return `nil`. It's very strange, because if I monkeypatch (e.g. `String length(): 10.`), or load the built-in `readline` lib, it will work perfectly.\n\nIt seems native extensions will work, but not potion functions themselves.\n\nBy the way, I've running OSX Mountain Lion if that somehow makes any difference.","files":null}]}
