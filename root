When I tried to test the build, I ran `make test`. 1 out of 282 tests failed saying that the recipe for the target `test` has failed. As far as I can tell two of the prerequisites of the target `test` are not available : \n```\ntest: pn libs test/api/potion-test${EXE} test/api/gc-test${EXE}\n\ttest/runtests.sh -q\n```\nI cannot see anything called `pn` or `libs` in the directory containing the makefile, although there is a `lib`. Did I do something wrong ?","files":null}]}
